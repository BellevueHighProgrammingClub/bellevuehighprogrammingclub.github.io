                        <h2> Internships </h2>
                        <p> The best way to get internships are by asking people around you! After reaching out to graduated BHS students, and asking how they got their internships,
                            almost all of them said it was through connections by their parents or friends' parents. Given our location, Bellevue and Seattle have many tech companies such 
                            as Amazon, Facebook, Google, Ebay, Microsoft, and more. No doubt many of the people in our own community work for those companies. People love helping out ambitious 
                            young students, so don't be afraid to reach out and ask for opportunities!
